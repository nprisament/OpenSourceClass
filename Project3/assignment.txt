Project 3: Creative Coding and Artistic Machines
Due: Wednesday November 14
Create a project with either Processing OR the Arduino OR both.
This is an open ended project.  Think of it as a sketch or experiment, a chance to explore.
Here are some possible starting points.  You may choose one of these, or come up with your own idea.

Drawing with Processing: create a Processing Sketch that explores drawing in an original way.  Think about introducing other kinds of code into the drawing, or incorporating video input, sound input or sensors.
Data Visualization: use a data set to create an image.  A starting point is this collection: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets and this tutorial: https://processing.org/tutorials/data/
Drawing Machine: use an Arduino to make a machine that makes drawings (considered broadly, as “drawing as marks”)
Processing and interactivity: create a sketch in Processing that explores interactivity and playfulness
Interactive object: take an everyday object and augment it with an Arduino and a sensor
